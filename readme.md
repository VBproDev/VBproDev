# 👋 Hey, I’m Viraj Bijpuria  
**Frontend dev | Accessibility (WCAG) | SEO**  

I build tools and websites that are **accessible, performant, and discoverable**. From no-code canvas apps for game devs to AstroJS integrations and converters for niche number systems, I like turning ideas into tools that people actually use.
