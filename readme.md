# 👋 Hey there, I’m Viraj Bijpuria  
Perfectionist. Indie dev. Open source contributor.

I love turning ideas into tools. Whether it's helping game devs draw on the canvas without writing a single line of code or scraping the web to find high-quality B2B leads, I like building, clean, and useful software—usually powered by TypeScript, Astro, all with a good dose of fretting over architectures and paradigms.
